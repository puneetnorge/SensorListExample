# SensorListExample
## IEquatable<T> interface with the type that is implementing this interface. 
## We should also override the base class implementations of Equals(Object) and GetHashCode() so that their behavior is consistent with that of the Equals(T) method
## Equality constraints help in preventing entering multiple copies of the same sensor on the List
